# Plutus Playground Tests
Small experiments with Plutus smart contracts.  
Purpose: Practice writing and deploying contracts on the Plutus Playground.

## How to load and run the code in Plutus Playground

1. Go to the official [Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/).
2. Create a new project or open an existing one.
3. Copy the contents of the `SimpleValidator.hs` file from this repository.
4. Paste the code into a new Haskell script file in the Playground.
5. Use the Playgroundâ€™s simulation tools to compile, test, and interact with the smart contract.
6. Explore modifications and try deploying different versions to understand how Plutus contracts work.
